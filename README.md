## üèÉ Getting Started
Hello, in this time i want to share about how to handling temporary failure. When we develop distributed system like microservices usually the service will communicate with other services, databases, messaging systems, etc. It could be in the communication process there is a temporary failure and a few moments later the communication is successful. This concept can help us manage traffic, avoid overload, and improve overall system performance.
